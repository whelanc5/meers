				I search for meaning by creating art in collaboration with the qualities and limitations of the physical. Through handling, observing, manipulating, listening, sensing, and responding to materials, I explore connections between the self and the external world. I try to capture internal, intangible experiences which inform spiritual understanding.
				My process is to construct pieces, combining intuitive, kinesthetic mark making and material handling with an overall vision that transforms as I respond to a work in progress. Evidence of construction is purposefully prominent, resulting in pieces which feel transitory rather than fixed. I strive to let the essence of each material have a voice within the creation of the work.
				I am interested in examining memory, longing, desire, time, entropy, transformation, love, and capturing the preciousness of acts by the human hand. Through books, prints, multi-media installations, and video and sound pieces, I offer sensory, bodily experiences and invite viewers to visit their own internal spaces. Much of my work tries to activate the viewer’s body by creating an environment they can navigate and explore physically and psychologically.
